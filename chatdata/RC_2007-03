Rocket science is simple relative to this.\r\n\r\nAgain, because details aren't simple to predict doesn't mean general direction can't be estimated.\r\n\r\n\"Mostly because you are fucktard.\"\r\n\r\nLOL  you can't even get the insult right.

If I write 67,000 lines of source code to print out \"Hello World\", that's also too much. \r\n\r\nBut *how* is it too much? The primary *way* that \"too big\" code is \"too big\" is not because it's verbose. It's because it performs too many operations. \r\n\r\nSo as I said, if you're counting characters or lines of source code, you're missing the point. Count operations. \r\n\r\nOf course, in order to count (or at least estimate) operations, one needs to understand both the compilation process, and the resulting machine or assembly language. And this, in turn, suggests an improvement exercise far more useful than golf:\r\n\r\nWrite compilers.\r\n\r\nWith a couple of compilers under one's belt, one begins to be able to pierce the abstraction layer of source code and think about what one's executable is doing on the metal. Certainly a profiler helps with this (and if you don't profile, then you're worrying about optimization too early), but a good coder should be able to predict with a good degree of accuracy what the profiler is going to tell him. \r\n\r\nIn sum, optimizations that shrink the source code may be true or false optimizations. Optimizations that shrink the machine code are true optimizations (for space), and optimizations that shrink the operation count are true optimizations (for speed). \r\n\r\nGolf may be valid on a level of 100k vs. 50k, but when one starts counting bytes, it's just a cleverness contest.

They've been engaging in terrorism for decades like the previous WTC bombing and the Al Khobar attack. *Most* terrorists don't get shit for their actions except a sense of perverse satisfaction - how has the life of the average Palestinian improved after the hundreds of bombs exploded in Israel by Hamas/PLO. Besides Osama probably believed the hype that he and his Taliban buddies were impregnable in Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to give you a conspiracy theory of my own.

From being an economic pariah, he became a major 'ally' in the war on terror, getting billions of dollars in economic and military aid. His selling nuclear technologies to countries like N Korea and Libya was overlooked by the US. Not to mention a lucrative book deal, and an appearance on the Daily Show. A member of a secret intelligence service that created and funded the Taliban in the first place, funnily enough, it was his country that would have benefited the most if the Unocal deal had gone through.

It's like saying that finding a quarter on the ground is like finding a suitcase stuffed to the brim with hundred dollar bills.  Sure, technically a comparison could be made, but only an intellectually dishonest person would make it.  In insisting on comparing Saddam to Hitler you are trivializing what Hitler did.  In trivializing what Hitler did, you are offering a defense of Hitler.  We already went over that and you just restated your erroneous view without addressing anything I said.  In offering a defense of Hitler you are really doing what you claimed Olbermann did, a claim you did not even try to defend.  How does it feel to be such an utter and complete hypocrite?\r\n\r\nYou are a moral degenerate incapable of admitting error no matter how egregious your errors are.  At this point, I'm not really offended since I can't really care too much about what you say, given that you are either so brazenly unreflective or so incredibly intellectually dishonest that your opinion has no value whatever.  While you should apologize, the apology you really owe is to yourself to yourself for debasing yourself this badly in intellectually immoral sophistry.  I do feel sorry for you, you've sunk yourself into a serious low, you have humiliated yourself.  All I can do is try to help, by recommending you face the truth.  The first step to facing the truth is learning to admit that you are wrong.  While it's hard to say, it appears that your egotism is likely to be at the root of why you can't admit your errors.

Think about checking for equality, for instance; if two numbers are unequal, then there will eventually be a digit in which they differ, so equality checking will terminate for them. On the other hand, imagine computing the same number by two distinct methods (e.g. using two different formulas for pi) and checking for equality. There just isn't a way to do this by looking at digits in the general case, because you'd need to check infinitely many of them. The only way is to have each number carry around its \"expression structure\" and use a theorem prover to verify or falsify the identity relating the two expressions--essentially what Mathematica and Maple do. But theorem proving in the real numbers is at least as hard as the halting problem.\r\n\r\nThat isn't to say that there aren't vastly better approximations to real numbers than floating-point arithmetic provides. I think even finite-precision fixed-point arithmetic is preferable in a lot of cases where floats are currently in use.

And those who didn't know him are immediately discredited.  \r\n\r\nBut, like others have mentioned, it's hard to think that a lot would have been written about someone who, originally, played a small role in a remote corner of the Roman empire.  I think if we apply the same historical tests that we do for other figures Jesus's existence seems to stand up.  \r\n\r\nBut, to play devil's advocate, maybe his existence was fabricated, and he never did exist.  That would make it a highly-successful work of wild fiction ( God has a son, son becomes man, man dies, rises again--that type of thing was an extremely hard sell to both Jews and Greeks at the time)  with original followers willing to face persecution and death to make it convincing.  Or, perhaps, Jesus was just a man who had a following and they really wanted to believe he was the Messiah so much they filled in the missing pieces after his death.  That seems at least more plausible, but then you're back to the idea that he really did exist.\r\n\r\nI think if you take it backwards--how did we get to here--and if you go all the way back you have these gospels, epistles, and secular documents written pretty closely to the time when Jesus was supposed to have existed.  If it were any other person people would accept that, because not only do you have the writings, you have the end result, a by-product that came from somewhere--Christianity.  \r\n\r\nIf you assume the author's intent (in the gospels and epistles) was to prove Jesus's divinity, and you marked all of those passages as questionable, it's still pretty certain that the non-divine person existed. The motivation of the writers and whether or not they sensationalized is one thing, even modern historians are guilty of that, but no one would question that the person probably did exist.  It's the unfortunate fact that he's tied to a religious movement that make it very hard to accurately look at his life.

The examples on this page\r\nare written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the\r\nHTML output produced by Markdown.\r\n\r\nIt's also helpful to simply try Markdown out; the [Dingus] [d] is a\r\nweb application that allows you type your own Markdown-formatted text\r\nand translate it to XHTML.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This document is itself written using Markdown; you\r\ncan [see the source for it by adding '.text' to the URL] [src].\r\n\r\n  [s]: /projects/markdown/syntax  \"Markdown Syntax\"\r\n  [d]: /projects/markdown/dingus  \"Markdown Dingus\"\r\n  [src]: /projects/markdown/basics.text\r\n\r\n\r\n## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes ##\r\n\r\nA paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated\r\nby one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like\r\na blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is\r\nconsidered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with\r\nspaces or tabs.\r\n\r\nMarkdown offers two styles of headers: *Setext* and *atx*.\r\nSetext-style headers for `&lt;h1&gt;` and `&lt;h2&gt;` are created by\r\n\"underlining\" with equal signs (`=`) and hyphens (`-`), respectively.\r\nTo create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (`#`) at the\r\nbeginning of the line -- the number of hashes equals the resulting\r\nHTML header level.\r\n\r\nBlockquotes are indicated using email-style '`&gt;`' angle brackets.\r\n\r\nMarkdown:\r\n\r\n    A First Level Header\r\n    ====================\r\n    \r\n    A Second Level Header\r\n    ---------------------\r\n\r\n    Now is the time for all good men to come to\r\n    the aid of their country.

These three markers are\r\ninterchangable; this:\r\n\r\n    *   Candy.\r\n    *   Gum.\r\n    *   Booze.\r\n\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n    +   Candy.\r\n    +   Gum.\r\n    +   Booze.\r\n\r\nand this:\r\n\r\n    -   Candy.\r\n    -   Gum.\r\n    -   Booze.\r\n\r\nall produce the same output:\r\n\r\n    &lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;Candy.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;Gum.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;Booze.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nOrdered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as\r\nlist markers:\r\n\r\n    1.  Red\r\n    2.  Green\r\n    3.  Blue\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you put blank lines between items, you'll get `&lt;p&gt;` tags for the\r\nlist item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting\r\nthe paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab:\r\n\r\n    *   A list item.\r\n    \r\n        With multiple paragraphs.\r\n\r\n    *   Another item in the list.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    &lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list item.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;With multiple paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another item in the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n### Links ###\r\n\r\nMarkdown supports two styles for creating links: *inline* and\r\n*reference*. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the\r\ntext you want to turn into a link.\r\n\r\nInline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    This is an [example link](http://example.com/).\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href=\"http://example.com/\"&gt;\r\n    example link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nOptionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:\r\n\r\n    This is an [example link](http://example.com/ \"With a Title\").\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href=\"http://example.com/\" title=\"With a Title\"&gt;\r\n    example link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nReference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which\r\nyou define elsewhere in your document:\r\n\r\n    I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from\r\n    [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].\r\n\r\n    [1]: http://google.com/        \"Google\"\r\n    [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo Search\"\r\n    [3]: http://search.msn.com/    \"MSN Search\"\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;I get 10 times more traffic from &lt;a href=\"http://google.com/\"\r\n    title=\"Google\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; than from &lt;a href=\"http://search.yahoo.com/\"\r\n    title=\"Yahoo Search\"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://search.msn.com/\"\r\n    title=\"MSN Search\"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nThe title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters,\r\nnumbers and spaces, but are *not* case sensitive:\r\n\r\n    I start my morning with a cup of coffee and\r\n    [The New York Times][NY Times].\r\n\r\n    [ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;I start my morning with a cup of coffee and\r\n    &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Images ###\r\n\r\nImage syntax is very much like link syntax.\r\n\r\nInline (titles are optional):\r\n\r\n    ![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg \"Title\")\r\n\r\nReference-style:\r\n\r\n    ![alt text][id]\r\n\r\n    [id]: /path/to/img.jpg \"Title\"\r\n\r\nBoth of the above examples produce the same output:\r\n\r\n    &lt;img src=\"/path/to/img.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Title\" /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code ###\r\n\r\nIn a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in\r\nbacktick quotes. Any ampersands (`&amp;`) and angle brackets (`&lt;` or\r\n`&gt;`) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes\r\nit easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:\r\n\r\n    I strongly recommend against using any `&lt;blink&gt;` tags.\r\n\r\n    I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&amp;mdash;`\r\n    instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&amp;#8212;`.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend against using any\r\n    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;p&gt;I wish SmartyPants used named entities like\r\n    &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mdash;&lt;/code&gt; instead of decimal-encoded\r\n    entites like &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8212;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nTo specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of\r\nthe block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, `&amp;`, `&lt;`,\r\nand `&gt;` characters will be escaped automatically.\r\n\r\nMarkdown:\r\n\r\n    If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,\r\n    you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:\r\n\r\n        &lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n            &lt;p&gt;For example.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,\r\n    you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\r\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n    &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\r\n    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n"}

(A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line \u2014 a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.\r\n\r\nMarkdown offers two styles of headers: Setext and atx. Setext-style headers for &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; are created by \u201cunderlining\u201d with equal signs (=) and hyphens (-), respectively. To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (#) at the beginning of the line \u2014 the number of hashes equals the resulting HTML header level.\r\n\r\nBlockquotes are indicated using email-style \u2018&gt;\u2019 angle brackets.\r\n\r\nMarkdown:\r\n\r\nA First Level Header\r\n====================\r\n\r\nA Second Level Header\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nNow is the time for all good men to come to\r\nthe aid of their country.

These three markers are interchangable; this:\r\n\r\n*   Candy.\r\n*   Gum.\r\n*   Booze.\r\n\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n+   Candy.\r\n+   Gum.\r\n+   Booze.\r\n\r\nand this:\r\n\r\n-   Candy.\r\n-   Gum.\r\n-   Booze.\r\n\r\nall produce the same output:\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Candy.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Gum.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Booze.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nOrdered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as list markers:\r\n\r\n1.  Red\r\n2.  Green\r\n3.  Blue\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you put blank lines between items, you\u2019ll get &lt;p&gt; tags for the list item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab:\r\n\r\n*   A list item.\r\n\r\n    With multiple paragraphs.\r\n\r\n*   Another item in the list.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list item.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With multiple paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another item in the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nMarkdown supports two styles for creating links: inline and reference. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the text you want to turn into a link.\r\n\r\nInline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text. For example:\r\n\r\nThis is an [example link](http://example.com/).\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href=\"http://example.com/\"&gt;\r\nexample link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nOptionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:\r\n\r\nThis is an [example link](http://example.com/ \"With a Title\").\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href=\"http://example.com/\" title=\"With a Title\"&gt;\r\nexample link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nReference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which you define elsewhere in your document:\r\n\r\nI get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from\r\n[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].\r\n\r\n[1]: http://google.com/        \"Google\"\r\n[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo Search\"\r\n[3]: http://search.msn.com/    \"MSN Search\"\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I get 10 times more traffic from &lt;a href=\"http://google.com/\"\r\ntitle=\"Google\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; than from &lt;a href=\"http://search.yahoo.com/\"\r\ntitle=\"Yahoo Search\"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://search.msn.com/\"\r\ntitle=\"MSN Search\"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nThe title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters, numbers and spaces, but are not case sensitive:\r\n\r\nI start my morning with a cup of coffee and\r\n[The New York Times][NY Times].\r\n\r\n[ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I start my morning with a cup of coffee and\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nImages\r\n\r\nImage syntax is very much like link syntax.\r\n\r\nInline (titles are optional):\r\n\r\n![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg \"Title\")\r\n\r\nReference-style:\r\n\r\n![alt text][id]\r\n\r\n[id]: /path/to/img.jpg \"Title\"\r\n\r\nBoth of the above examples produce the same output:\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=\"/path/to/img.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Title\" /&gt;\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\nIn a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in backtick quotes. Any ampersands (&amp;) and angle brackets (&lt; or &gt;) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend against using any `&lt;blink&gt;` tags.\r\n\r\nI wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&amp;mdash;`\r\ninstead of decimal-encoded entites like `&amp;#8212;`.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend against using any\r\n&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I wish SmartyPants used named entities like\r\n&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mdash;&lt;/code&gt; instead of decimal-encoded\r\nentites like &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8212;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nTo specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, &amp;, &lt;, and &gt; characters will be escaped automatically.\r\n\r\nMarkdown:\r\n\r\nIf you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,\r\nyou've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:\r\n\r\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For example.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,\r\nyou've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\r\n    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nShop at Amazon.com and support Daring Fireball\r\n\r\nSyndicated RSS Feeds   |   Display Preferences\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2002\u20132007 John Gruber\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1172726183,"subreddit":"reddit.com"}

There's just a lot more schmucks playing the lottery out there so they tend to be the winners and hence why we hear countless stories of millions squandered.","link_id":"t3_175jj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1172728616,"score":17,"ups":17,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"fake0","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_175jj","id":"c1760m","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473819389,"distinguished":null}

Minarchism accepts a minimal state.  Like David Friedman, I do not.\r\n\r\n&gt; David Friedman has written very well on the subject.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you should actually read him.  He does a much better job of giving a detailed response to your question in his [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machinery_of_Freedom) than I could possibly service in a simple reddit comment.  It's simply beyond the scope of this medium.  You should also take a look at [this recent compilation](http://www.mises.org/store/Anarchy-and-Law-P335C1.aspx) which contains the writings of most of the major thinkers on this subject, including David.\r\n\r\n&gt; my justice and law enforcement company is the city, which contracts with the county, which contracts with the state, which contracts with the federal government, which contracts with various foreign justice and law enforcement companies.\r\n\r\nYet all of those organizations have effectively *monopoly control* over their given territorial area, and they maintain that monopoly through violence rather than competition.  That would be the difference between a market-based system of justice and protection and what exists currently.  Look up \"polycentric law.\"\r\n\r\n&gt; Of course, I am putting up: I'm proposing to be subject to the same watch levy. Moreover, I am putting up by proposing to live in a corporation which exacts such a payment from its citizens. You're free to move down the road to another such corporation.\r\n\r\nYou presume this \"corporation\" (government) owns the property I live on.  Where exactly did it get that title?  I'm the one who lives here, not them.  I dispute the ethical legitimacy of any claim they have over my money for the purposes of funding their protection racket.\r\n\r\nAnyway.  My point is that you're replacing one system of tyranny with another.  The police state is a system for the enforcement of the State's claim to monopoly power over their chosen territorial region.  And don't get me wrong, I can certainly see the advantages if officers of the State were chosen randomly from the citizenry rather than simply appointed by those already in power.  But it's a step towards improvement *at the cost of* implementing a whole new system of control, with its own chances for abuse.  And it will *still* ultimately be managed by those in power.\r\n\r\nA market for law already exists.  Private protection agencies are a first tiny step in a mostly right direction.  So your suggestion for conscripted watchmen is not only harmful, but ultimately irrelevant (I'm 99% convinced it is will never happen).  What we should focus on is making sure this burgeoning system of private law enforcement moves in the *right* direction towards replacing the current system of tyranny with a more voluntary system - rather than turning into its own system of tyranny, which I admit is not outside the realm of possibility.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_16u0j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473819392,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"academician","id":"c1766w","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c1764d"}

And sometimes it doesn't even matter if your code is good or bad.\r\n\r\nThe only way to make a case why you should be paid 3x the average is to show that you finish your projects in 1/3 the average time. Unfortunately, you may not be able to accomplish that even if you could code at 3x the average guy because it's not just about coding. It's about dealing with ambiguity and crappy, non-existing documentation and chasing down other devs who don't answer your email and explaining to the idiot customer why that is not what he wants or waiting for somebody to come along and tell you what the customer really needs."}

For example, the anti-ID one about the Viking version of intelligent design. That cartoon made its point in such a way that you could get it as a believer without feeling personally insulted. This cartoon though has no message other than, \"Your beliefs are no different than worshiping a rock, and they make you irrationally violent,\" which is pretty much the definition of creating and using a negative stereotype.  Is it really the case that all believers are unthinking ignoramuses? What about Kant or Kierkegaard? Is it really the case that all religious people are violent? What about Mother Theresa, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, etc.? \r\n\r\nPainting all these counterexamples away with a broad brush is what it means to use a stereotype. It's like I made a cartoon that say, \"The history of black culture: listen to rap and shoot each other!\" Yes, there are some black people who do that. In fact, you might even say that is glorified by some parts of black culture today.

It seems there were a lot of players working in tandem against the Soviets, and a lot of money floating around, from all sorts of sources.

I was born in 1960 and being a tad precocious came to political consciousness at the end of Wheen's chosen period, 1950-1973. I remember a national teachers' strike in 1969, home from school, hurrah! I remember the electricity going off in 1972 with the \r\n[miners' strike](http://www.agor.org.uk/cwm/themes/events/1972_1974_strikes.asp)\r\nDad had a Tilley lamp. You pumped it up by hand and it sprayed parafin onto a mantle, like in a gas lamp, giving a bright white light.\r\n\r\nThe adults were in a flap. Politics was highly contested. Should the banks be nationalised? Nationalisation was getting an increasingly bad name as politicians struggled to make it work in practise. The bitter struggle was fought over the nuances of corporatism. Big government, big business, nation trade unions, all tied together by the expertise of experts. Remember \"experts\", they were the big thing before \"market forces\", fixing exchange rates and designing capital controls to maintain them. As the wheels came of the UK economy and it slumped into stagflation the experts designed prices and incomes policies and the businessmen and trades unions got stuck into gaming them.\r\n\r\nYears later I read a book by J.K.Galbraith. I expected to read the left-wing/social-democratic solution to the problem of stagflation, but he dismissed the problem because the word was ugly.\r\n\r\nMy father was an engineer, so I had access to a narrative of economic progress than ran orthogonal to politics. If I wanted to understand prosperity I needed to look at jet engines, television, plastics, CNC machine tools.\r\n\r\nI grew up in a Britain that was coming to feel that it had missed out on the post war boom because of capital controls, fixed exchange rates, strong trade unions, a large public sector and a general acceptance of government's role in demand management.\r\n\r\nMore important was the realisation that you couldn't have both unemployment and prosperity. People had to make things, or provide valuable services to people who made things. This was why people tolerated Thatcherism and the high unemployment that her policies created.\r\n\r\nConfused? People in the UK in their 50's have lived through a hard lesson that you cannot hide unemployment. Having people in government/protected/subsidised jobs in which they don't actually do very much doesn't work. Soaking up employment with unproductive busywork doesn't work either. The phoney jobs and the hidden unemployment had to go. Obviously that meant real unemployment, but the really unemployment find jobs, the hidden employed stay where they are.\r\n\r\nFrancis Wheen is writing in a UK paper for a UK audience. He is painting a picture of 1950 to 1973 that attributes the successes, such as they were, of that era to particular policies.

And I said 'not at peak yet' to set a bound on recovery cost. Although some people, notably [Mathew Simmons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Simmons), think the largest field, Ghawar, is already in decline. Since Saudi Arabia doesn't disclose it's production records, the actual state of their reservoirs is unknown. \r\n\r\nThere are about 80 fields in Iraq but 3 giant fields, Kirkuk in the north and 2 fields in Ramalia in the south, with proven reserves of 16 and 20 billion barrels respectively. Those fields are old and have been badly mismanaged, making recovery much more costly than the $1 per barrel stated in the article. [Here](http://www.nps.edu/cebrowski/Docs/energy/giantoilfields.pdf) is a 67 page pdf file on the state of the largest oil fields in the world. The paper was probably written in the 2001/2 timeframe.

Its one billion barrel Rataw oilfield, its Majnoon field, which has an expected initial output of 300,000 barrels per day with later development yielding possibly 600,000 barrels per day or more and its Nahr Umar field with potential of producing around 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day of light gravity crude are all great examples of new giant fields yet to be exploited.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not a petroleum engineer or a geologist, just a lowly physicist with an interest in the world I live in. And although I agree with the main point of the article, that the US has always had one thing in mind in the invasion of Iraq and from that perspective, the invasion has been a disgusting, nauseating, success, the author uses misinformation to make his point.

{"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1172759734,"author_flair_css_class":null,"body":"Deary, deary me, back to the insults again.  Here's [one for you](http://www.aut.edu/english_prog.htm).  My, aren't we grown-up?\r\n\r\nOn to your actual arguments... Recall that I asked for posts that said \"clearly and unambiguously\" that Hardaway \"should... have been prevented from saying these things by law\".\r\n\r\n&gt; Being honest does not automatically make someone's views right or acceptable for broadcast.\r\n\r\nAcceptable for broadcast != legal.  In many countries hardcore porn is legal to indulge in, but not legal to broadcast.  This is a moral argument criticising Hardaway's poor judgement, not one stating he should be legally punished for his beliefs.  Next!\r\n\r\n&gt; In the UK we have a legal term for this: \"incitement\".\r\n\r\nThis was one of the closer comments to the line.  Nevertheless, he merely observes that we have a term for this in the UK - I don't recall him saying that people like Tim Hardaway should be punished for such speech or prevented legally from saying it.  For what it's worth, you could act exactly as Tim Hardaway did in the UK and although you might get a lot of complaints to the radio station, and he might get sued (a *civil* case) you wouldn't end up in jail.  Next!\r\n\r\n&gt; People can say whatever they like about anyone as private individuals. But that is not the same as someone who is a role model who chooses to broadcast hateful views over public media.\r\n\r\nNo comment on the legality on it - I read this as a moral argument - \"shouldn't\", rather than \"shouldn't be allowed to\".  It's not unambiguous, and hence inapplicable to my request.  Next!\r\n\r\n&gt; That is incitement\r\n\r\nI don't recall where this comment came from, but once again it's name-calling at the act Hardaway committed.  It is emphatically *not* stating he should be *legally punished for what he said*.  Next!\r\n\r\n&gt; People reduce the right to what they can say when they choose to become representatives of larger groups, or choose to become famous.\r\n\r\nClose to the line again, but stops short of saying he should be punished legally for what he said.  Again, can easily be read as a moral obligation rather than a law, and that's how I took it.  Obviously you did not.  In fact, the way the sentence is phrased it even implies that assuming the role of a spokesperson or representative implies *you yourself* voluntarily give up or reduce a right to freedom of speech, and this is worlds away from someone else censoring you.  That's why I asked for \"unambiguous\" comments.  Next!\r\n\r\n&gt; Here in the UK we have laws against discrimination. It is perfectly acceptable for anyone, as an individual, in private, to say what they like. However, things change if you decide to broadcast such views\r\n\r\nStates a fact.  Explicitly allows Hardaway to hold these kinds of opinions and share them with others.  States that Hardaway could be in trouble if he *broadcast* such opinions over here.  Again though, he could legally say such a thing in the UK and he *wouldn't* be legally punished.\r\n\r\nThere would be morally outrage, complaints to the station, the station and/or Hardaway might lose sponsors and supporters, but Hardaway wouldn't be imprisoned and wouldn't be legally in trouble.\r\n\r\nI make that 0/6, and I gave you one of the longest comments threads I've ever seen on Reddit to cherry-pick your evidence from.\r\n\r\nNot to be funny, but if you can't find **one example** of someone saying Hardaway should have been legally prevented from saying what he said, maybe your assertion that\r\n\r\n&gt; \"A lot of people are saying that [Tim Hardaway should be prevented from saying he hates gay people]\"\r\n\r\nWas... perhaps... wrong?\r\n\r\nAnd that, by extension, maybe your assertion was baseless, and that... *just perhaps* your inability to produce one *convincing* argument to defend your opinion indicates it might be... indefensible?\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to make you look stupid here - I'll admit my earlier \"pulling baseless assertions out of your arse\" comment was motivated more by frustration than I'd like, but my point remains valid:\r\n\r\n* You've asserted that Tim Hardaway was somehow morally superior to Takei, even though Hardaway \"started the fight\"... but haven't given a reason much beyond \"Yuck!  Gay!  Urgh!  Hence Wrong!\".\r\n\r\n* You've asserted that Hardaway was expressing very abstract disagreement with homosexuality as a concept, and that's been proven wrong (\"I hate gay people\").\r\n\r\n* You've then diverted from the topic at hand to assert that people on Reddit are seriously arguing that Hardaway should have his right to freedom of speech infringed, but have yet to show a case where this has unquestionably happened.  You've even got an entire archive of the whole conversation available to you, and can't come up with even a single quote to demonstrate it for sure.\r\n\r\nAgain: **I'm not trying to have a go at you**, but can you honestly look back over the comments for this article and still claim that:\r\n\r\n* You're definitely right?\r\n* You've made good, convincing arguments?\r\n* Your opponents haven't made *much* better arguments in favour of their positions?\r\n* People seem to respond to your approach?\r\n* You've persuaded *anyone* round to your way of thinking?\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I understand that you, like others here, have strong beliefs on the topic.  What I'm asking is if you're able to step back from them and consider the debate dispassionately.\r\n\r\nIf not, you won't be even close to being \"right\" because the only way to determine \"right\" is to do it logically and rationally, which means avoiding letting emotion cloud your thinking.\r\n\r\nIf so, doesn't the fact that probably *hundreds* of other posters all agree that you're in the wrong (or at least, that it's just a judgement call with no \"right\" or \"wrong\" side) make you wonder if, just maybe, your logic is faulty?\r\n\r\nIf you accept that you disliked what Takei did and obviously see nothing wrong with what Hardaway did, but that that's just your opinion, fine - I'll accept the same thing about my opinion, and we'll call it quits.\r\n\r\nHowever, all I've seen so far is (basically) \"you're all wrong because I don't like gay people either, and the fact that you disagree with me means you're all pinko liberal queer-lovers who secretly don't like gay people but who have been cowed and brainwashed by poofs into saying you like them\", which implicitly asserts there *is* A Right Answer and that you're saying it.\r\n\r\nSo which is it?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_16k04","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473819409,"author":"Shaper_pmp","author_flair_text":null,"id":"c1773e","parent_id":"t1_c175dp","edited":false}

{"body":"See, this is the problem.\r\n\r\nYou dump irrelevant, inaccurate, bogus information in a forum like this. Someone replies with an opinion based on better information, and you whine about us not taking the time to educate you, and simply repeat your stupidity. \r\n\r\nThe article you cite dresses up a completely bogus fire model with a bunch of Chemistry 101 calculations to make it seem more scientific than it is.\r\n\r\nBasically, there are at least two major faulty assumptions.\r\n\r\nOne is that additional fuel added to a combustion process simply adds linearly to the heat output of the fire. I.e., you can take \"normal office\" and \"puddle of jet fuel\" and burn each individually and add up the total heat output to find out what the effect of \"normal office sprayed with jet fuel\" is. \r\n\r\nThis is obviously not true: fires are highly non-linear. The presence of accelerants changes how much fuel gets involved and how quickly, and can greatly increase the resulting temperatures. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it assumes the heat was distributed evenly throughout all the materials in each floor, as opposed to a producing a range of temperatures from very hot to survivably cool. Theirs is an absurd model, particularly because they take *all the concrete in the floor* and assume that it gets *all* heated up as much as the hottest spot on the floor. \r\n\r\nThere is going to be a wide range of temperatures in any fire, and the critical thing left out of this analysis is *any* consideration of thermal conductivity.\r\n\r\nThe NIST folks, including experts in building fires, created far more elaborate models and simulations, and came up with quite different results than this naive model.\r\n\r\nApparently, you *are* prone to believing random shit you read on the internet.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_16rpg","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1172763212,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"sickofthisshit","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_c017799","id":"c177i7","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473819416}

That's like saying it's the only job of the programmers to obey the pointy haired bosses![1]  In both cases professionals of a technical field[2] are saddled with weak-willed idiots who don't know the first thing about the jobs they are supposedly managing.

If anything, this is more true about soldiers as they not only comprehend the technical details of how to succeed militarily, but also are intimately aware of the situation on the ground.  That is to say they have better domain-specific decision making capability AND better data to base decisions upon.\r\n\r\n[2] Anyone who thinks that soldiers are not in a technical field simply doesn't know what they are talking about.  Maybe in the ancient past when the only skill a soldier needed was to not flee in terror at the approaching pike-phalanx that wasn't the case, but those days are long long past.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_1760p","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1172766369,"author_flair_css_class":null}

Leicester 59.6% white. \r\n\r\nAnd then:\r\n\r\nCorby 5.7% unemployed. Rest of the country 5.2% unemployed.\r\n\r\nSo what about Leicester\u2019s unemployment rate? Hard to say, it depends on whom you ask, it is a slippery thing to measure. Estimates vary between [4.8%]( http://www.investleicestershire.com/template02.asp?PageID=70 ) and [8.5%]( http://www.hrmguide.co.uk/jobmarket/regional_unemployment.htm ) which make me doubt Corby\u2019s figure. However the TUC describe Leicester\u2019s unemployment as the [worst in the East Midlands]( http://www.hrmguide.co.uk/jobmarket/regional_unemployment.htm ). The only direct comparison I could find was of the [Local Authorities Index of Multiple Deprivation](http://www.advantagewm.co.uk/downloads/annex-c.pdf ) (sorry, PDF) which ranks Leicester as 31st most deprived in the country and Corby as only 74th most deprived. \r\n\r\nIn other words Leicester probably needs the jobs more than Corby, has a bigger pool of qualified potential employees and is a more practical location. \r\n\r\nNext storm in a teacup please.\r\n\r\nEdit: formatting","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_176qb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1172766512}

If life on Earth is too complex to have originated spontaneously, then too any potential designer would necessarily be too complex to exist without something that designed it.

Are you getting it now?\"\r\n\r\nYou retard.  You STILL don't get it.  OR and AND have little difference here.  If raising rates can do A OR B, then last year it might do A, this year it might do B, next year it might do A again.  It means rate raising causes BOTH to happen.\r\n\r\nYou're so fucking stupid.  The short bus is calling you back.\r\n\r\n\"Yes sometimes it goes up after a raise in interest rates sometimes it goes down. Do you dispute this?\"\r\n\r\nNo, but what I dispute is that you believe it's the cause for when it goes down.  It's not a freaking matter of turning on a light switch.  If a ball is rolling down an incline, adjusting the incline to be less steep or even horizontal won't necessarily stop the fucking ball from rolling.  There's already energy in the ball keeping it rolling one direction.  It's called Inertia.  Increasing interest rates only starts the adjustment in the incline and might not adjust it quickly enough to keep the ball balanced.\r\n\r\nThere. You claim to think you understand physics, so I put it in a form you *might* understand.\r\n\r\n\"So it has some unmeasurable effect. If the effect is unmeasurable then it's not science. Sorry.\"\r\n\r\nThen global warming is not science.\r\n\r\nRetard.  It doesn't make it not science simply because it hasn't been measured. Do you FUCKING UNDERSTAND the concept of science?  Science isn't merely measuring shit.  It's creating a theory to fit existing facts, and gathering facts to try to disprove it.  You don't ignore known facts because they don't fit your idealogy, but YOU continue to do so.\r\n\r\n\"right. You can never make an accurate prediction about the effects of any cause because the system is too chaotic.\"\r\n\r\nNo, I said the model is too complex.  I didn't say it will ALWAYS be too complex.  The fact is that people are attempting to grow better models to be able to predict the weather AND to be able to predict results in the economy.\r\n\r\nBut even if it's too complex to estimate where the ball will be on the incline, it's generally accepted and NOT disproven that lowering tax rates have a positive affect on the economy and increases tax revenue over time.\r\n\r\n\"I agree with that 100%. There is no such thing as cause and effect in economics. Any effect that may or may not happen can never be correlated with any cause.\"\r\n\r\nNo, that's not what I said, nor is that true.   You are ignoring facts again.  Remember Zimbabwe?  What happens when a country starts printing money faster than the economy can absorb it?  Inflation.  \r\n\r\nYou CAN attribute causes.  For example, the 70's luxury tax on yaught sales caused the yaught industry to basically collapse.  People stopped buying new boats here and instead the prices for new boats went up.  See?  Basic cause and affect.\r\n\r\nYou might as well claim that there's no science in throwing a ball, because it MAY or MAY NOT break a window.  The fact is there IS a science called physics that can calculate it, but it's difficult to measure the relevent factors when a child throws it at the house.\r\n\r\n\"Economics is an ideology. It's less of a science then psychology is.\"\r\n\r\nI think you are thinking of psychiatry.  Psychology is a science too.  You still don't understand the concept of science.  It's a matter of gathering facts, creating theories, and trying to break those theories with new facts.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the existing theories and data can't answer all the questions DOESN'T make it non-science.  If it did, then physics wouldn't be a science either, since it has yet to answer ALL questions about the universe.\r\n\r\nYou're so fucking clueless.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_16fnj","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1172770052,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1}

I'm guessing you mean the sticker price, because you don't know any of the actual costs unless you happen to have a price book, which isn't the same one that is available to the general public.\r\n\r\nEven if you know the price book cost of the car, you don't know how much the dealer paid since it fluxuates depending on how many cars he sells for the year.  If he buys enough cars from an mfr this year, the mfr will lower the cost of everything he's bought this year.  So if he sells a few more and can order more, his cost goes down.\r\n\r\nSo, assuming you know the dealer's price is X for the car, you now go in to haggle.  Unfortunately, you're under the impression that the negotiation will be honest on the part of the salesguy, who's been trained to try to get as much out of you for everything else.  Warrantees, undercoats, extras, interest rates, fees, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sticker price is only the first step in the negotiation of a car.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if there's a price on the car already, then how much money I have is rather irrelevant, as long as it's enough to cover the price. \"\r\n\r\nNot true.  One of the things the dealer is going to try to get from you is how much money you have or can afford.  Then he'll do everything in his power to make sure you spend that much.  If you base your negotiation on how much per month to pay, he'll be happy to do so. Unfortunately, you won't notice him making it a 5 year loan at a high interest rate.\r\n\r\nIf you nail him down on a price for the car and an interest rate, he'll raise something else to cover it.   He may go back to \"ask his boss\" too, but it is merely to make you wait and bored.  The more he makes you not want to be there, the less you'll want to negotiate and the easier you'll give in on things.\r\n\r\nThere might also be a microphone hidden in the room so that the salesguy can eavesdrop on you.\r\n\r\nI don't believe any of these things are honest either.\r\n\r\nNegotiation during the sale of a TV is obviously an accepted part of buying it too, since if it wasn't, the salesguy at best buy wouldn't try it.\r\n\r\nYes, it would be great to be able to buy everything without dealing with dishonesty, but it happens and it's best to be prepared to deal with dishonest people or you'll be cheated.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_1728h","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473819435,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nosoupforyou","id":"c178jl","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c017568"}

I've also not had that many compatibility issues, but maybe I'm just lucky.\r\n\r\nWanna know a secret too? I switched to Vista from Linux. I'd been using Linux for 5 years exclusively on the desktop at home and after 5 years I'd come to the conclusion that it still isn't ready for *my* desktop. (PLEASE note how I'm stressing *my* - Linux may be ready for *your* desktop and I'm glad it is).\r\n\r\nLinux is great for server work - databases, LAMP, proxing, etc. And that's where I use it in my job.\r\n\r\nWindows also has some great server technologies (Active Directory, Group Policy, MMC, WSUS, MSI installers, Exchange, etc) and some great desktop technology too. While I've seen the Linux equivalents of most of those technologies they generally don't match up to their Windows counterparts.\r\n\r\nI don't care if they've ripped on Apple with Vista - I can't afford an Apple. I can't afford Vista either but our license agreement at work (a school) entitles me to a copy, so I ran with it, and here I am. I don't care about DRM because I don't use anything that has DRM in it and I can't see myself in the future. Security wise, I've been in the IT business for many years now and I know how to secure a network/PC, so I'd say I'm safer than the average user.\r\n\r\nAnother sin is that I believe Office 2007 is, quite frankly, amazing. Alright lets face it - all that's new is the interface, but goddamn, that is enough. I've used functionality in the past few weeks that I never knew was there in previous versions because it was hidden away in menus. Office 2007 *is* innovative and I'd recommend it to anyone.\r\n\r\nSo these people can rip on Microsoft all they want. I've actually *used* Vista for a period of time and I'm happy with it. I can play all my games - no compatibilty issues here yet, tho they're a bit slow sometimes. Come on Nvidia!! - Which is something I missed being on Linux for years.\r\n\r\nSaying all this...

(I'm saying that not because I expected you to read it, but because I find API documentation to generally be worthless; so far I've only encountered one other project that does it \"correctly\", with a high-level overview at the project level to help you get oriented. So it's worth pointing that out.) Feedback about the documentation welcome.\r\n\r\nRight now, I find the syntax for passing things further down has been somewhat questionable in practice (the \"use_subfunction = {'param1': 'param for subobject'}\" syntax). I don't know if this is because it is actually bad, or because in practice you just end up not needing it very often and I end up forgetting how to do it. (Generally if you keep passing the same sub-param down, you should write a new creation function that explicitly takes that parameter; same refactoring rules apply to test code as anything else, in my experience.)\r\n\r\nI also wouldn't be surprised Ruby can add some cute little syntax trick to make it even slicker.

I am sure that someone far smarter than me could do an impact analysis on various situations. I won't hold my breath but I would think that we have a good idea what the outcome of a successful terrorist attack on a reactor would look like.\r\n\r\nMy father did exactly this kind of work for Boston Edison and their Pilgrim Nuclear Power Plant in the 80s. His results, which I cannot provide figures for (they just aren't available) says that fission plants are generally much safer from infiltration and attack than you'd think.\r\n\r\nFirst off, you just won't see the kind of fire that happened at Chernobyl due to a completely different reactor design. Simply put, while lots of stuff can burn, the nuclear moderators in light water pressurized reactors don't. About the single worst thing you can do is cause a loss of coolant accident, and that's the kind of thing where safety overrides would have to occur in multiple points in the system for something really nasty to happen. Lastly, you won't have the \"guy driving a busload of explosives through the front gate\" because plants are generally built on massive amounts of land, the perimeter around which can be several miles from the plant itself."}

The two men, both wearing the hats of their respective veterans associations, were drinking toasts to each other on an island in the Pacific that, being of no further use to the U.S., was being returned to Japanese control.  During World War II the two men had tried to kill each other while serving in opposing armies fighting for control of what was then a strategically essential\" island.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, all I'd been taught during my middle western upbringing about war unraveled, and I saw just how stupid  those two guys had been.  I especially saw how stupid the dead or permanently disabled guys who weren't in the picture had been.\r\n\r\nIf I had a kid today, one of the lessons I would begin teaching him from early infancy and continue teaching him throughout his life is this: Whatever you do -- don't be the chump that fights a war.\r\n\r\nI'd teach him that if he simply can't avoid being around somebody else's little war, then he should be the strategic policy advisor that sits in a comfortable chair and writes article about how useful the war would be.  Or the cabinet official who sits safely in his office and writes public relations statements about the necessity of the war.  Or be the general that wears a tailored uniform while well within a protected perimeter and issues briefings that describe how well things are going.  Or best of all, be the defense contractor that makes piles of money for supplying the aforementioned architects, advocates, and managers of the war.\r\n\r\nBut whatever you do, don't be the chump that actually fights the war.  Because even if you don't suffer a permanent injury that makes you wish you'd been killed instead, you're still the chump.\r\n\r\n*You* won't get a sinecure as a government policy consultant, you won't get a better job within the administration, you won't get an extra star, you won't make any money.  What you'll get is a $1.95 campaign ribbon, bragging rights at the VFW, and little or nothing else for your future.\r\n\r\nThe way I feel today is not how I was raised, for sure.  But it's how I today view the stupidity of people who get suckered into fighting wars so that the survivors can put on their silly hats and enjoy a champagne reunion on the same ground where their friends had a few years earlier bled pointlessly to death...","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1172776382,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com"}

The satisfaction they receive by looking at their body, the sex, etc. What part of this is not true?\r\n\r\nAll of it. \r\n\r\nMan, just listen to me for a minute. Stop typing and start reading and thinking because you're making yourself look an ass.\r\n\r\nGender dysphoria is NOT about looking at your genitals and feeling \"sexual satisfaction\". I don't believe you're a stupid person, I just think you're young and prone to to shoot your mouth off without knowing what you're talking about.\r\n\r\nLet me put it as simply as I can - imagine (if you can) going though life feeling as though you're in the wrong body. You're labelled a male, a man, yet inside you feel more like a woman. It's probably more than just a feeling - in many ways you act like a woman, have the same interests as women, even think like a woman. Yet everyone calls you he. You look in the mirror and see some awful man looking back at you when you really want to see a woman looking back on you because that's what you feel like inside.\r\n\r\nImagine going into denial about it. You get married. You take up male persuits - maybe join the armed forces, or become a fireman, maybe race motorbikes. Yet the feelings of wanting to live life as a woman just won't go away.\r\n\r\nYou get to a certain age and you see life passing you by. You've lived life as a man and you hate it, but whenever you present or interact as a woman you feel *right*.\r\n\r\nEven though I've just explained this to you, you will never be able to truly understand it as you're otherwise a gender congruent male. You would only understand if you were forced to wear a dress and be called Stacy for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nThe people who congregated at the town hall may as well have come armed with burning torches. Where's the love that Jesus teaches in the bible? The truth is, most of those people are ignorant of transsexual issues, they showed no compassion, and frankly some of the comments in that thread were asinine at best and moronic at worst.\r\n\r\nHave you seen the film Idiocracy?

Is asking doctors and insurance companies to be transparent really so bad? Another example might be monopolies.

{"body":"I hate reading this crap.  OK computer weanies, some notes to success (in your job, finances, happiness, maybe even bed):\r\n\r\n1.  Employees are hired to make the employer richer.  Period.  You are just a tool to make someone else richer, so deal with it and move on.  Yes, even contractors and consultants.\r\n\r\n2.  It's only a job.  Work it to the minimum.  Don't stress it.  Remember #1 above?  Why do you want to add stress to your life while making someone else richer?\r\n\r\n3.  Being really good at your job, pre-management, ruins your chances of succeeding past your current job position.  Why would they want to promote you out of your current position when you are doing so good at it?!  If you do #2 above, you will move along quite well even in management positions.\r\n\r\n4.  Complain.  People who complain more get more.  Quite people get screwed.\r\n\r\n5.  Spend less time at your desk, more time around the water cooler/coffee maker.  I don't know how many socially inept computer weanies I have met over the years who might as well be working in a dark basement.  Socializing GREATLY improves your chances for promotions.\r\n\r\n6.  Vacation and sick days: use them.  Refuse to do any work while away.  People who wimp out here are just panzies that say \"I bend for anyone\".  How do you expect people to respect you when you don't even respect yourself?\r\n\r\n7.  Don't accept a company cellphone or pager.  Tell them you think the things cause cancer or something.  If you are forced one, never use it.  And if you have a personal cellphone never ever ever give the number to a coworker or your boss.  If they want it, say its your \"personal\" cellphone which means its \"personal\" and if they want to reach you they should give you a cellphone (see #4).  Again, don't use it when they give it to you and leave it everywhere.  A few dunks in the toilet will usually solve most crappy company phones.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_178c3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1172785013,"score":33,"ups":33,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"sbrown123","edited":false,"id":"c17aad","parent_id":"t3_178c3","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473819469,"distinguished":null}

So, to say that it is the same type of disorder is misleading.

This can generate enough heat to make the reactor core melt down, and you'd have to clean up the containment structure later. Darn.\r\n\r\nThis reaction to loss of coolant is inevitable because the coolant is also the moderator. In the incident you cited, there was no coolant loss. The coolant circulation systems lost some of their power because of an electrical problem, and the reactor was automatically scrammed. The danger in losing coolant circulation is that the coolant will overheat, and it won't be able to cool the reactor properly. In this case, the reactor was in no danger of meltdown according to Sweden's official analysis of the incident.\r\n\r\nIt's a nasty incident, to be sure -- but even the worst-case scenario, meltdown, isn't that bad.

S(he) would try to play the feminine part by flirting and body contact and would sometimes make odd double entendres (perhaps not knowingly).  Adriana and I worked together for almost a year and the times I'v run into her since we've been cordial.  I wouldn't claim we were friends insofar as we never socialized, but we certainly treated each other with respect and both came to know each other as people.  Never did I find myself afraid of Adriana or disliking he(r).  I did find myself puzzled by Adriana's predicament.

And when applied straightforwardly, that advice is dead wrong.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started programming, I wanted to be as \"professional\" as I could.  Naturally, this meant I *always* looked around to see if someone had implemented what I was about to implement, and used their code if possible.  I also stuck to documented interfaces and made sure I read the documentation before hacking around.  These are all habits that have served me well.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've seen organizations that take this to whole heights of ridiculousness.  Like trying to shove their entire application into XML config files, a la Struts/Hibernate.  Or the Java EE stack in general.  Worse yet, Java EE with JSF, Facelets, and A4J layered on top of it.  Developers go to such lengths to avoid writing any actual code that they mire themselves in Framework Configuration Hell.\r\n\r\nI've also seen organizations make completely ridiculous choices about *what* to build and what to buy.  Like building their own proprietary database because standard SQL engines aren't good enough, and then mandating JSF for the web tier because their web technology *must* be Java, because their proprietary database has only a Java interface.\r\n\r\nThe correct answer is always \"It's complicated.\"  There's a very complex series of tradeoffs involved when you choose to use someone else's function vs. write your own, and you may be paying for them several years down the line.  Unfortunately, the only people I know who actually admit that it's complicated are grizzled computer veterans with 25+ years experience, and nobody listens to experienced computer programmers anyway.","created_utc":1172792423,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t3_17b08","edited":false,"id":"c17b6u","author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473819486,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0}

A contract like this 30 yr deal is for exploitation of a reservior, but you're right, it depends on the size of the reservior and the rate of extraction. The big, as yet unproductive reserviors,  in Iraq hold anywhere from 1 to 15 billion barrels and are projected to have peak extraction rates in the 300k to 600k barrels per day range. \r\n\r\nBut there wiil be anywhere from 5 to 10 years before the fields become productive at all, then the fields, as all fields do, follow a Hibbert curve. The first 1/3 of recoverable oil comes out of the ground fairly easily, the last 1/3 takes a lot more effort. So, assuming a peak extraction rate of 300k barrels per day and recoverable amount of 2 billion barrels, the field could easily last for 40 years, which is 15 yrs or so beyond the length of the contract.\r\n\r\nI can't answer the second part of your comment because it makes no sense."}
{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_178fg","subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"I'm going to start off by saying that I'm not trying to put you off, I'm just going to be honest with you.\r\n\r\nATCers are a very special breed of people. You can either do it or you can't. If you're in the latter category and you some how muddle your way through the training program, you *will* eventually quit or have a mental breakdown. OTOH, if you're good at it, it's an amazingly easy job that pays very well. Though you do have to work some crazy hours at times.\r\n\r\nSo I imagine you're asking yourself, so am I type A or B? Well, at the very minimum you must be able to visualize things in your head without any trouble at all.\r\n\r\nBasically, you have to look at a screen (radar -- and no it's not like it is in the movies), look at a bunch of pieces of paper with more detailed information, and then, in your head, \"see\" all of the planes going to their destination in three dimensions.\r\n\r\nNow, throw in factors such as changing altitude and limitations of airplanes (climb/descend/speed performance) into the whole mix.\r\n\r\nFinally, because things were just getting easy right, you now have to go by the rules. There, obviously, are rules governing distance required, both vertically and horizontally, between airplanes at all times.\r\n\r\nThis is an easy, \"ideal,\" scenario.\r\n\r\nIf you're working with planes that are not on radar, then suddenly everything becomes a lot harder. The rules of distance change dramatically and there are a lot more \"head computations\" that you have to do to make sure everything is going good. Hope you're good at math (somewhat) because now speed, and thus future position, is critical into your calculations.\r\n\r\nAnother, less-than-obvious requirement, is that you be able to listen and talk *fast*. I mean **fast**. Typically, it's not that imminent that you're a speed talker. But if the weather gets bad, you'll get busy quick and you have to communicate a lot of information to a lot of pilots in a short amount of time. Depending on your area, though, this may not be as big of a deal as I make it out to be.\r\n\r\nIf none of what I've said sounds too crazy then I would highly suggest that you look into it. It's obviously scary to think of doing all of that, and to be fair I did trump up reality a bit, but once you do it a few times it's not that insane. Right now, the industry is on the verge of an almost panic-like-state because of the sudden outflux of controllers that will be leaving very shortly. They will need some more people to man the towers/etc very soon and I wouldn't be surprised if the pay was increased to complimented the situation.\r\n\r\nIf you live near a local \"aviation\" college, you should check them out and see if they offer an ATC course or something. If nothing else, it will give you some nice insight into what it's like so you can really know if it's for you. Good luck, if you need me to digg some stuff up for you I'd be more than happy to.\r\n\r\n* Note: not a controller -- just a pilot that took course(s) / knows some.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1172797397,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":28,"ups":28,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_c17amb","id":"c17bnc","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lespea","retrieved_on":1473819495,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0}

But you are either an incredibly bad reader or you are extremely intellectually dishonest, either way it's not flattering.\r\n\r\nFirst off let's deal with the word \"like.\"  If likeness purely subjective as you have said before, then we cannot argue either way right?  You cannot disagree with me any more than I disagree with you.  But here you are disagreeing with me.  Either you don't believe what you said, or you are extremely confused.  I am going to assume the latter.  I hope the fact that if you think something is subjective you are in no position to argue about it is clear to you now.  If you really believe it, just say we are both right, and you'll be off the hook.\r\n\r\nSecondly, when you make an argument saying that a thing is like another thing there is some implicit stuff going on.  Any thing in the universe can be said to be like another thing in some respect, just as it can be said to be unlike on other respects.  The color blue can be said to be like a banana inasmuch as they both start with the letter b, they both are things that can be said to exist in some way, and so on.  But if you want to go saying that bananas are like the color blue normally people would say that is absurd.  If you qualify it by saying that bananas are like blue inasmuch as they both start with the same letter then people would not be inclined to disagree.\r\n\r\nYes, finding a quarter is comparable to finding $100,000 on the street inasmuch as they both involve finding money, but that's not the point one would be making.  If you qualify the comparison with \"inasmuch as they were both discoveries\" or \"inasmuch as in both cases money was found\" or what have you then you can make whatever comparison you like.  But without that qualifier you are going to be comparing the most obvious aspect, the quantity of money, and they are not like in that respect.\r\n\r\nWhen you compare historical figures with other notable figures in history, what people will assume you are comparing are those most notable aspects of those people.  If you say a person is like another person with no qualifications you are implying that they are more like than not.  So if you were to say that Thomas Friedman was like Hitler normal people would think the comparison is absurd, because when you say \"like Hitler\" they are going to be thinking you are comparing a dopey author/NYT columnist to a guy who killed 6,000,000 Jews, mostly in concentration camps, caused 62,537,800 war dead, started a war that engulfed the whole planet, or other similar things that he was notable for doing.  When you say that Saddam is like Hitler, we all know what is meant.  You mean he is more like than unlike.  You are not saying that they both were male or had mustaches.  You saying that what Hussein did is reasonably comparable to what Hitler did.  But they are not reasonably comparable.  Hitler's differences weren't even just a difference of degree, they were a difference of *kind*.  No rational educated person familiar with history would seriously agree to the statement that Condaleeza made, it was stupid.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I can fathom why you would agree with the comparison is because a Republican said it and you insist on being loyal to your team even when it means you have to say really stupid things.  You think of politics like team sports where you support your side even when they are caught cheating, and curse the other team even when they are better.  Republicans want their faithful to demonize Saddam, you are a good little tool doing just what they want.  If Hillary Clinton had made the same remarks, I am sure that when the Republicans sent out their pitbulls you would be right there with them cursing Clinton for her anti-Semitism or whatever.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you said that finding a quarter was like finding $100,000 I would not be offended, I would just feel badly that you were such a mental cripple.  The fact that you couldn't actually argue with anything I said, but instead imagined my reaction to some hypothetical statement shows that you really can't defend your position and you know it.  Instead you continually pull out red herrings, try to distract from the incredibly stupid things you said previously, and refuse to even acknowledge that you said them, presumably because you are well aware of how foolish you look, but don't see how much more foolish you look by acting like a coward and not defending your own words.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that you need a thesaurus or something similar.  You appear to have have a very limited vocabulary.  Smart people are good with words.  Smart people don't sink to infantile name calling, and certainly don't repeatedly use one weak jab.  Using \"dumbass\" over and over just makes you look like you are not the sharpest tack in the box.  Maybe you should try reading a few books with big words in them some time to learn how to properly throw out insults.  Repeating \"dumbass\" ultimately just makes you (amazingly) look even less bright than you already look.\r\n\r\nFinally whether Hitler is or is not like Saddam is a tangent.  You said that Olbermann was defending a dictator.  That was moronic.  You appear to know that what you said was moronic since you keep trying to shift the topic to Hitler comparisons, which were a tangent and a red herring you pulled out right from the top, apparently to try to distract from the stupid things you initially said.  If you reply to this and do not address the question of whether Olbermann was defending a dictator, as you haven't for the last eight comments, I won't respond.  You'll get in your last word, and can feel good about yourself.  But you should also be aware that the reason I will not respond is because if you can't defend your statement but continue arguing you are not a rational person, and I have no time to waste on you.  My silence will only be an indicator of your intellectual inadequacy, the depths of which are so great that you can't follow even the simplest thread of an argument.  It will be a shame upon you, a sign of your mental weakness being so marked that you are not worth discussing things with, an emblem of the immaturity of your mind.  The choice is yours, either defend your initial statement or show yourself to be incapable of honest discussion and end it by tacitly admitting that you do not have the mental capacity to hold up your side of a conversation with an adult.  You've walked away from enough arguments with me in the past were it was clear you'd lost.  If you fail to answer once more, it will be a pyrrhic victory for you - you get the last word in but still lose by choosing to not actually offer an argument regarding Olbermann defending dictators.  If you just bluster on about Saddam being like Hitler or do more name-calling, we both will know that you are admitting defeat.","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1172808360,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_c17c59","edited":false,"id":"c17cky","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473819512,"gilded":0}

{"body":"I haven't actually read Korzybski's *Science and Sanity* (has anyone, really?), but I have some familiarity with GS from reading Hayakawa's *Language in Thought and Action*, Edward McNeal's brilliant *Mathsemantics*, and various references in books by Neil Postman. \r\n\r\nI think e-prime has merit as a way of encouraging clear thinking. As a parent, I believe it's a good idea to avoid [unnecessary identification](/info/166vf/comments/c168sf) in speaking to children. As a writer, I find that avoiding gratuitous use of \"to be\" makes for tighter, more vibrant language.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think e-prime has fallen into the trap of reifying Korzybski's musing on the \"is of identification\" (recall that Korzybski himself wrote, \"The map is not the territory\") and missing the bigger picture. The Robert Anton Wilson article you cited smacks of cargo cult thinking about what he calls \"the software of E-Prime\". \r\n\r\nSometimes, language must articulate identification, especially in logical rather than descriptive communication. The verb \"to be\" is ideal for this. Further, the conceptual framework that GS encourages can survive the occasional use of \"to be\" as a copula (my new favourite word, by the way) rather than, to [borrow a phrase](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm) from George Orwell, to \"say anything outright barbarous\".\r\n\r\nAs for the original point of this thread, a neighbour of my acquaintance survived Dachau and appears quite capable of discussing it with others using conventional language in a way that makes it feel chillingly authentic, even if we did not experience it ourselves.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_175d0","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1172808787,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"c17cm9","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c17cgm","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473819514}

We would spend all day together, laughing and chatting away. It was a give-give relationship, we both gave a little bit of ourselves and the result was something beautiful.

I had truly found true love. My joy knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nAnd then the inevitable.\r\n\r\nMy boss set me up on a blind date. He told me that it would be no big deal, just a quick hello, nice to meet you, have a good night. I knew deep down I shouldn't have accepted. But, after some persuasion, I reluctantly agreed and we met the following day.\r\n\r\nAt merely a first glance my breathe was taken away. My skin grew hot and I felt beads of sweat welling up as my heart tried relentlessly to release itself from its cage. How gorgeous. How elegant. Only seven wonders of the world? Ha!\r\n\r\nI tried backpedaling, knowing that once I got my hands on it, my self control would be over. It was hopeless, though. I watched, horrified, as I was drawn in. My tension was released in torrents of emotion. Little time had passed before I noticed how exhausted I had become. My hands ached from the relentless massaging they had done. I had worked that code up and down, both outside and in. Nevertheless, I pressed on.\r\n\r\nEach new moment was heaven built upon itself. Just as I thought I had reached my peak, I would attack from a different angle. I implemented techniques that I had only read about in smutty hacker magazines. I even made up a few right there in the heat of the moment.\r\n\r\nAs everything was drawing to a climax, I calmly reached a plateau in a state of Zen. Though it only lasted a few moments, my thoughts echoed for an eternity.\r\n\r\nThis was a culmination of everything that every person ever dreams of. And I had lived it.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nLike the boss had said, our coupling was just a quick meet and greet.  When we were inevitably separated, I knew we had both been forever changed. I would never look at another piece of `tail` the same way again. Nor would I ever take as much pleasure, as much glorious, glorious pleasure as I had experienced then. I was both delighted and horrified.\r\n\r\nFinally, the time came to face my once true love. I said nothing, I received nothing. I knew my secret permeated the air; my skin reeked of guilt. Dirty.\r\n\r\nWe soon parted ways. I never heard what become of my long lost love. Rumor has it, that it moved on to a small server somewhere out in the country. Hopefully, that code found somebody that would give all the respect and love it deserved.\r\n\r\nAs for me, well, that's another story...","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_17bcl","stickied":false}

The initial \"seek counseling\" joke was simply based on the fact that you appear so confused and incoherent that you don't seem like a normal rational person.  That's not intimidation, that's the facts.\r\n\r\nYou kept calling me and others names.  You then then went on to go accuse others of calling people names suggesting that doing so is irrational.  \r\n\r\nYou cajole others for not offering arguments when you have made large numbers of posts where there is no argument to be found, just infantile insults.  People notice it if you curse others for not offering compelling arguments when you yourself don't even seem to have a passing familiarity with logic or common fallacies.\r\n\r\nWhat are we supposed to think?  You are either a mind-boggling hypocrite, you are mentally ill, or you are as dumb as a brick.  But those aren't exclusive, and I think in this case it may be a bit of all of the above.\r\n \r\nThe fact that you are freaked out by homosexuality combined with the fact that you appear to have enough mental problems to make you look like a poster child for cognitive dissonance suggest that you have something going on in there that some parts of you are fighting.  Being a closeted gay is the kind of thing that could cause a person like you to behave so bizarrely.\r\n\r\nBy the way, when a person gets as unhinged as you can get, it brings out the worst in people since it's perversely fun to make fun of people who are not very bright, prone to emotional outbreaks, and hold really poorly thought out political views that only a mental cripple would take seriously.  \r\n\r\nSorry, I feel kind of bad mocking you, but it's also pretty amusing.  You see, it's much more fun to accuse homophobes of being gay than well adjusted people.  If someone called me gay I wouldn't care one whit, it's not an insult as far as I am concerned, just an incorrect label.  But if someone accuses a homophobe of being gay and they will start to foam at the mouth, and that's kind of amusing to see.\r\n\r\nBy the way, continuing on with the general theme of your mental inadequacy, you and I were not having an argument here.  There's a good reason why I didn't use a persuasive argument for anything in this thread.  I wasn't really so much talking to you, as mocking you.  All I did was point out to others what a complete hypocrite you are and make fun of you a bit.

{"body":"As for sock puppets:\r\n\r\nSo, 'the gay admin cabal' who had it in for you connived to go to a library near your home in Mass. to post as 'Hernado Cortez?'  They did this without even knowing where you live?  That's quite impressive, perhaps they could do this because they are snappy dressers who can hide in shadows anywhere.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps cabal then contacted the independent CheckUser team and asked them to fake data about you?  From my reading the CheckUser team ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHECKUSER ) has access to the private IP logs of wikipedia and therefore they are very terse in their statements.  When I started reading this interesting saga, I found the CheckUser report on Mr. Cortez - they thought the fact that he only started posting recently, only to the article you were interested in, only doing the same exact edits you were doing (3RR stuff apparently) and doing it from a library terminal in Mass near your normal comcast cable location pretty much guaranteed that he was a puppet.\r\n\r\nFor the other reported puppet 'Yuuta' - you actually made reference to getting a puppet.  Duh.  For more details see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Lou_franklin\r\n\r\nHere's an example post from the liberal 'gay' cabal trying to reason with you:\r\n&gt; Lou, I am not gay, as you acknowledge, I am a conservative, which you seem to want to dispute despite having been given plenty of evidence, and your explanations for what you're trying to do here are not credible. Stop giving conservatives a bad name. We are not all homophobic assholes, but that's exactly what you're making us all look like. In pointing out the flaws in the article and provoking change you have done good here with this article, but there are reasonable normal people all across Wikipedia (and Free Republic, and others) who are seeing this behavior and looking at you and going \"Who is this nutcase?\".\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; You're going to get Arbitration called on you when you keep this up, and you're going to be blocked indefinitely from any edits to the article pages related to homosexuality, and you're going to entirely deserve that. Because you're an unrepentant far-right extremist bigot, and everyone from mainstream Republicans on left can see that. And I'm going to be dealing with the bad PR repurcussions that you've laid at the feet of all \"right thinking people\" for years to come.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;  If you actually cared about this issue, you'd self-limit yourself to not editing the article ever again, and limit yourself to talk page discussions about it. The article is getting fixed. However, the little good you're doing on actual article edits is getting completely lost in the noise of your insane fixation with McCarthy's \"cocksuckers\" comment and on pedophilia.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  I somehow doubt that you will exercise self-restraint, but I can hope.\r\n&gt; Georgewilliamherbert 07:14, 1 March 2006 (UTC) \r\n\r\nAs for threats, the final trigger (there were other similar comments) was:\r\n&gt; I am being falsely accused, and I suspect that you know it.

Will moderate or infrequent cannabis usage still increase the probability of the user developing a mental illness?\r\n\r\nI know that (and cases like this happen all the time) if someone where to drink a bottle of vodka very quickly they might very well die when their central nervous system shuts down along with their respiratory system. Or, they might drown in their own vomit if the pass out on their backs. That same bottle of Vodka consumed over the course of a year would be quite safe -- from a lethal dose point of view. However, a couple of shots of vodka is enough to impare driving ability. \r\n\r\nCompare the above to cannabis where their is no known lethal dose. In fact, a recent post on Reddit cites a study that shows that a person could, in theory (because I would guess it's not possible in practise), smoke 25 kilograms of cannabis and still live. (I skimmed that article so I could have mis-read something. Apoligies if I got it wrong.) That would make cannabis less poisonous to the human body than plain old water -- which if you drank too much of could kill your kidneys and you. Also, according to the study below:\r\n\r\nCannabis consumption does not impare driving ability:\r\nhttp://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/432/duidresearch.shtml\r\n\r\nDrug policy is failing (in part) because of a lack of consistency and fairness at its foundation. How can anyone treat with respect any set of rule and regulations that at their core is willful ignorance of plain-to-see facts. \r\n\r\nI have seen first hand the effects of alcohol on people and I have seen the effects of cannabis. If drug policy were based on actual potential for harm (and the known negatives of prohibition) I firmly believe that cannabis would be legalized.

{"body":"&gt;the \"suffering\" involved in having 30% of your paycheck taken away...\r\n\r\n...is annoying, certainly, but not suffering. Doesn't mean it's right. But that wasn't the suffering I was talking about -- I meant suffering like a messy divorce (or watching your parents have a messy divorce and getting caught in it), or losing your job and then your house, or having a family member die.\r\n\r\n&gt; ...doesn't compare to the suffering going on in Africa or China or India, so why radically change such a successful system?\r\n\r\nThe system has been changed radically by every group that has gotten into power. The government today is not very much like the one we started out with.\r\n\r\nAbout First Principles: everything's part of the world we live in -- politics, physics, biology, philosophy, everything. If you base a political system on human nature, you need psychology/sociology, economics, philosophy...\r\n\r\n&gt;Now I just have to find out if you're a Propertarian.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what the connotation is, but I do believe private property is best for a successful economy. After living in a co-op and other similar situations, it's become clear to me that people -- even die-hard collectivists -- don't take care of stuff that isn't theirs (meaning, they can do whatever they want with it).\r\n\r\nRegarding laziness: I disagree, and it looks like we won't change that disagreement. From my experience with co-operative living (and elsewhere), people won't do things that aren't necessary to them if they can get away with it. How many times do people give a excuse of \"it's too hard\" for not doing something they have a reason to? How many lottery winners blow all their money as soon as they can, instead of doing the work necessary to make sure they can live on it for the rest of their lives? You say \"Left to their own devices, people overwhelmingly choose work,\" but that's not what I meant. Of course they choose work when they're left alone, when they have no choice. Everyone has to eat.\r\n\r\nBut when you've got one of the two major political parties telling people that it's not their fault they're poor, they won't work to better themselves -- after all, if it's someone else's fault then there's nothing you can do about it. And they believe it, because they want to, because it makes life easier.\r\n\r\nRegarding violence -- again, I disagree. It's not the gap that leads to violence; it's the level at which a large group of people live, in an absolute sense. No matter how big the gap between the rich and poor in America, the vast majority of the poor can afford to feed their children -- it may not be easy, but they get food. (And even though the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer, that's only in a relative sense -- by absolute standards like nutrition, the standard of living of the poor has gone up enormously from, say, the 19th century.) In Africa, it doesn't matter how small the gap between most of the people in a given area there -- if there are not enough resources, there will be violence.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_16cil","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1172822220,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lynn","parent_id":"t1_c16ym4","id":"c17df3","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473819528,"distinguished":null}

Fine, but it may turn out to be less then productive if your arguments turn out to be backed by nothing but your subjective expierence however.\r\n\r\nWant to publicly voice your convictions and entice others to adopt them as well?

We don't put people in jail for getting drunk, people who are drunk can do very stupid things. People who are high can do very stupid things, but we arrest people who are high on weed. What is truely ignorant of the government is to fail to recognize that when you put people in prison, they go from obedient citizens--other than the few times they get high--into efficient criminals by the time they get out due to the fact they had mentors or were forced to evolve into a criminal mentality. If prisons were not such huge enterprising entities drug offenders might have a change to evolve into say educating themselves. Instead of helping prisoners, they are punished to the highest degree, especially those with drug offenses.\r\n\r\nThe problem to all of this really comes down to the fact that the largest organization in the country with the most clout when it comes to shaping law involving prohibition is the prison guard unions all throughout the country. It is in their best interest to keep those who break their moral standards be forced to goto jail and allow them to keep their job in punishing people by locking them up with nothing to do with their time.\r\n\r\nIf our country actually listend to hard science instead of pretend not to be a general theocracy, we might actually become a better country.

Jesus is about the only thing that makes sense in the bible. He might actually have existed. He was probably a pretty cool dude, even. A good, very successful prophet.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of him beeing the son of an eternal entity witch have existed for all time and who created the heaven and the earth and man from clay and women from man-ribs.. An eternal entity whom drowned the entire earth at least once (without leaving any evidence of such a catastrophy), planted dinosaur-skeletons and fossils at random places to fuck with our heads, and spoke directly to a bunch of people so they could write this eternal entities wiews on pretty much everything from love with animals to the dangers of thinking for yourself... Come on.\r\n\r\nIt's all about power and politics. I'll admit that there are some pretty neat ideas printed down in the bible. Be cool, stay in school. Be a good friend. Don't kill. Think before you act.. But it's probably just the result of a chaotic society witch needed some ruels and restrictions to function properly. And christianity contains a lot of easy answers to a lot of very difficult questions. \r\n\r\nSo..It was adapted to fit the current society, to get some structure. And later, it became a great tool to control people and to get money and power. \r\n\r\nIt's no coincidence that all the religious holidays (in sweden) (christmas, easter, etc), is held the very same days our ancient heden rituals took place. These days were already celebrated by the vikings when they where converted into christianity. So when the missionaries were to christian the hedens, they found that it would be much easier to take their current \"holidays\" and replace \"thor, odin, frej, ragnar\u00f6k &amp; valhall\" with \"god, jesus, heaven and hell\". Just an example of how the voice of god gets distorted sometimes.\r\n\r\nAnd why god left it up to a handful of people to spread his message? On just one continent, too. If he spoke to people once, he could easily just have a word with some of the tribes in the Amazon, or the genereal american continents, and straighten them out, too. So that when columbus came 1400-years later, we'd all have the same religion and nobody had to kill anyone.\r\n\r\nBut god works in mysterious ways! Right?!\r\n\r\nI could go on, but I guess poo will come out of my mouth if \r\nI continue.\r\n\r\nAnyway. The whole thing just seem ridiculous. Jesus make sense. All the other god-related-stuff does not.

He comes to China every 3 months, with tales from Dubai and Iran. \r\n\r\nIn the Iranian general population, no one likes the President Ahmadinejad anymore than to have him removed from power. If you Google and read up on some Iran commentary, the fact is that the President is not well liked for his domestic policies. Unemployment is high, the economy is not doing well, and his focus with being tough with the US while his domestic agendas are non-existent makes a lot of Iranians upset.\r\n\r\nThey are waiting for him to leave the office and are ready to vote in the current Mayor of Tehran. \r\n\r\nBut on the other side of the coin, is that Pres.Ahmadinejad and the Supreme leaders, the Ayatollahs at the top (who are not Iranians but Arabs) control the army. Iranians do not even like the religion that is imposed upon them by the Arabs leaders. They are installed to make Iran weak, as the Arab countries view Iran as a potential threat to their existence.\r\n\r\nThere was recently a video about Skiing in Iran on Reddit.com. The people you see are like, Western Europe white Caucasians folks. And they are the real Iranians. If you look up the original race of Iran, you will see that they share the same race as Germany. They are the Aryan race. \r\n\r\nAnyway, to continue the other side of the coin argument, the people might not be strong enough to push over the current government or the spiritual leaders. But an U.S. attack on Iran will provide just the opposite push, it will make the Iranians embrace their leaders and fight against a common enemy. \r\n\r\nThe above are all comments from a retired army soldier who served for Iran for 2 1/2 years after the Iran-Iraq war.

These two anecdotes, if they suggest anything at all, suggest that prohibition is an ineffective way of protecting people from harm.\r\n\r\nIf an anecdote is to imply that a controversial law is to be retained it needs to contrast the bad things that happened before the law was enacted with the good things that the law has brought. For example, grandfather smoked marijuana and committed suicide in the 1920's. Uncle was going the same way in the 1930's but prohibition came in; he couldn't get weed any more and lived happily ever after. \r\n\r\nProhibition is a costly policy. If it is to produce a net benefit, there must be scope for such a benefit. Given the costs of the policy it could only ever be reasonable to prohibit recreational drugs that are conspicously harmful, in a way that marijuana clearly isn't. But the *possibility* of benefit is not enough. The policy must actually deliver. Anecdotes alleging harm under the current policy tend to undermine current policy.\r\n\r\nI find it troubling to read of depressives committing suicide in the context of marijuana and the current controversy over prohibition. Why do depressives commit suicide? One feature of depression is a feeling of being cut off. One doesn't ask for help. It is not just that there doesn't seem to be any point, the illness creates a little glass bubble and locks you up inside, unable to contact others.\r\n\r\nHaving to be careful who you tell in case your unsuccessful attempts at self-medication with marijuana get you prosecuted is an additional problem.

Unfortunately, to get at the full text you need an subscription, so it's hard to see what this breaks down into.\r\n\r\nBasically, though, \"administrative costs\" in the U.S. are dominated by two factors: the cost of health care benefits management at each company that provides insurance to its workers and profit margins at every stage of the game. Things like paperwork are not unique to the U.S. system.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear that these dominant \"administrative costs\" are dead weight. Companies don't *have* to hire benefits managers, they could just sign up for some service that gave them the cheapest plan. But presumably a company like Google or Microsoft pays its health benefits managers pretty well because they want them to seek out the best plans and benefits so they get skilled, happy, productive employees. I don't think Google would *save* money by firing their benefits manager and just grabbing some plan off the shelf.\r\n\r\nProfit margins provide a similar incentive in the other direction: provide better services so you make more money.\r\n\r\nSo it's not obvious to me that simply \"cutting out\" all the administrative costs would make the *overall* costs lower. There's a good chance they'd be higher as inefficiencies crept in that weren't whittled out by competition and the watchful eye of cost-cutting benefits managers. It's not like the \"lower administrative costs\" Medicare is a bargain!\r\n\r\nGenerally, not just in health care, it's a mistake to confuse the level of these sorts of \"administrative costs\" as a counter-indicator for \"efficiency\".\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473819540,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c17dm4","id":"c17e2u","author":"twoodfin","author_flair_text":null}

I know of many people with problems from insomnia to OCD to glaucoma who use it successfully (and yes, notice that that brief list includes some mental disorders).  A more complete list of conditions (I presume anecdotally) reported to be treatable with cannabis is available at: [http://www.ukcia.org/medical/medicalusages.html](http://www.ukcia.org/medical/medicalusages.html).\r\n\r\nSome people will use cannabis and find it helps.  Others will use it and find it doesn't help, or makes things worse.  Some will use it, find it doesn't actually help but stupidly continue to use it.  I'm sorry, but these people are foolish, and you can't protect against foolishness.\r\n\r\nAspirin is a useful drug for self-medication.  Some people find it doesn't help with some conditions.  Some people even use it to deliberately commit suicide.  We don't ban Aspirin, because if you aren't a complete idiot about it, it's useful.\r\n\r\n&gt; How about the basic logic that if someone's predisposed to feeling like shit,\r\n\r\nSomeone who has a condition should be very, very careful when trying any new medication.  That doesn't mean it's stupid to try, and it certainly doesn't mean it won't help.  you appear to have a problem with basic logic.\r\n\r\n&gt; a drug that gives you a temporary heightened sense of elation then brings you back down,\r\n\r\nYou've not really used cannabis before much, have you?\r\n\r\nPot doesn't \"give you a sense of elation\" any more than caffeine \"gives you a sense of elation\".  Sometimes when you're on a really good caffeine buzz you feel energetic and elated, but not all the time.  Exactly the same goes for pot - *some* people get elated *some* times.  Some just giggle like idiots.  Some become incredibly motivated and creative.  Some fall unconscious or can barely move from their bean-bags.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, pot does not \"bring you back down\" - *there is medically no hangover from pot*.  I don't know where this stupid idea comes from, but it seems disturbingly prevalent.  Hangovers are caused by a quick ramping down of the active ingredients of a drug in your system - either because it's quickly processed and rendered inert or because it quickly exits your system.  Cannabis takes a relatively long time to be cleared from your system, and stays in the system at a very low level (ie, below judgement or ability-impairing level) for *days*.  I'll say it once again: according to our best medical science *there is no hangover effect from cannabis*.  The worst effect you'll get is mild dehydration if you didn't drink enough water the night before.\r\n\r\n&gt;or possibly gives you a sense of paranoia might best be avoided.\r\n\r\nAgain, paranoia is generally because you've been doing it in the wrong place with the wrong people at the wrong time in the wrong frame of mind or in the wrong amounts.\r\n\r\nFuck up and pot makes you paranoid.  Aspirin, alcohol or paracetamol can kill your ass.  Your call.\r\n\r\nTo summarise: Yes, if you're a very stupid person then taking cannabis to help with a mental problem is a very stupid thing to do.  However, if you're remotely sensible then you either avoid using it (which, believe it or not, you can *choose* to do), or if you find it helps with your condition you carry on using it *sensibly*.\r\n\r\nJust because something can be misused doesn't mean you should ban it.  By that rationale we also wouldn't be allowed knives, guns, cars, aspirin, tall buildings, tin-openers or sharp bits of paper.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_17ahw"}

{"body":"Thanks for wasting my time. You're full of shit: there was no explanation of the video this post is about in the page you linked to.  Just a bunch of crap about 'the danger of conspiracies' and princes Diana.\r\n\r\nHave you even watched the video in question?\r\nHere's a link, for as long as it lasts:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KztvvgT0P2E&amp;NR\r\n\r\nPlease, someone, explain all this away.  I'd love to believe that my government (or elements of it and the military-industrial complex) *didn't* allow or make 9/11 happen.  I'd *love* to believe that they were just complete idiots, and that they've gone to such lengths just to cover up *that* fact.  I'd love to believe that steel substantially weakens at the uncontrolled (or even controlled) burn temperature of kerosene (or office furniture), or that WTC7 (the solomon-brothers building) collapsed neatly into its own footprint because of the ridiculously small amount of damage it sustained.\r\n\r\nPeople who argue that it's more unlikely have hollywood visions of what such a conspiracy requires.  There are accepted historical 'conspiracies' (such as the manhatten project) that kept secrecy among a group of thousands.  I would be surprised if a hundred people knew exactly what was about to happen before the eve/morning of 9/11. Even people performing important roles could have been handled under cover of drills.\r\n\r\nEven if 19 muslims were the only actual 'performers' on the day, it is not precluded that they knowingly or unknowingly acted at the behest of american (or just non-muslim-fundamentalist) planners and backers.  \r\n\r\nAnd then ask yourself, Qi Bono? Who benefits?  Who *has* benefited?  Not Bush really (I think he is a pawn), but many elder-Bush and Cheney allies have certainly profited from the trillion dollar war they brought about. Larry Silverstein, leaseholder of the trade center complex (a recently acquired, financially-questionable, 100-year lease), benefited to the tune of at least 3 billion dollars in insurance (with specific acts of terrorism clauses). He sued for a double payout of around 7 billion (there were two acts, he said), and I've read that he was awarded it, and that he wasn't; it hardly matters.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_17btw","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1172837718,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"momerath","author_flair_text":null,"id":"c17e74","parent_id":"t1_c17dun","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473819543}

Tiny particles of soot or chemical compounds like sulphates reflect sunlight and they also promote the formation of bigger, longer lasting clouds.\r\n\r\nThe BBC documentary suggests that:\r\n\r\n&gt; But perhaps the most alarming aspect of global dimming is that it may have led scientists to underestimate the true power of the greenhouse effect. They know how much extra energy is being trapped in the Earth's atmosphere by the extra carbon dioxide (CO2) we have placed there. What has been surprising is that this extra energy has so far resulted in a temperature rise of just 0.6\u00b0C.\r\n\r\n&gt; This has led many scientists to conclude that the present-day climate is less sensitive to the effects of carbon dioxide than it was, say, during the ice age, when a similar rise in CO2 led to a temperature rise of 6\u00b0C. But it now appears the warming from greenhouse gases has been offset by a strong cooling effect from dimming - in effect two of our pollutants have been cancelling each other out. This means that the climate may in fact be more sensitive to the greenhouse effect than thought.\r\n\r\n&gt; If so, then this is bad news, according to Dr Peter Cox, one of the world's leading climate modellers. As things stand, CO2 levels are projected to rise strongly over coming decades, whereas there are encouraging signs that particle pollution is at last being brought under control. \"We're going to be in a situation, unless we act, where the cooling pollutant is dropping off while the warming pollutant is going up. That means we'll get reduced cooling and increased heating at the same time and that's a problem for us,\" says Cox."}

Even though you can apply the tests to samples obtained in any other way, they don't define \"better randomness\".\r\n\r\nLet me elaborate: if an experiment is random, then it's random, period. There's no such thing as \"more randomness\", or \"better randomness\".\r\n\r\nOne thing that one could test for is how uniform the samples are, and I get the impression that this is what many people refer to when qualifying randomness. Flipping a coin that falls on \"head\" 90% of the time is still a random experiment, even if the resulting distribution is not uniform. It is just \"as random\" as flipping a perfectly balanced coin.\r\n\r\nOne other thing to test for is how well the samples fit a particular purpose. For instance, if you are running a simulation of a communication system using white noise, then you want your noise samples to meet certain criteria. If you are simulating failures in a manufacturing line, then you almost certainly will require different criteria.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject is pseudo-random generators, then the problem changes. The general test for pseudo-randomness quality is uniformity, since one can easily generate many other distributions from a uniform sample. This is what Marsaglia tests for. However, there are other possible criteria.\r\n\r\nSorry if I'm coming across as pedantic, but this is one of my favorite subjects :)"}

It very often turns into a vicious cycle, where you drink to escape your problems, but the problems get worse because you are escaping them --- and of course alcohol brings along problems of its own, which very few people would deny.\r\n\r\nThere are three issues all people who use drugs (incl. alcohol) or advocate their use/legalisation should be aware of:\r\n\r\n1. People have irrational, magical beliefs about the effect of drugs. Most drugs (exception: hallucinogens like LSD) do impressively little to your mind, and most or all of the desirable effects are produced by user expectation. This is why you have to \"learn\" to like both alcohol and cannabis. This does not make drugs less powerful, because self-deception _is_ a powerful thing.\r\n\r\n2. There is an interesting phenomenon known as self-handicapping. If you give one group of students an unsolvable puzzle, and one group a rather easy one, and you offer them alcohol halfway through, guess who drinks the most! It seems people deliberately handicap themselves to preserve their self image if they fear they might fail. Ever wondered why so many smoke pot in college? Perversely, some people may even find it easier to be a complete loser with a justification (say drug addiction) than a mediocrity with only yourself to blame. That's what we get for being a society on the higher levels of Maslow's pyramid.\r\n\r\n3.

Besides being a general nuisance in villages, ancient Malagasy legend said that the Aye-aye was a symbol of death. It is viewed as a good omen in some areas, however, but these areas are a minority.\r\n\r\nResearchers in Madagascar report remarkable fearlessness in the Aye-aye; some accounts tell of individual animals strolling nonchalantly in village streets or even walking right up to naturalists in the rainforest and sniffing their shoes. Therefore, it is no wonder that displaced animals often raid coconut plantations or steal food in villages. It is not unlike the American raccoon in this regard.\r\n\r\nHowever, public contempt goes beyond this. The Aye-aye is often viewed as a harbinger of evil and killed on sight. Others believe that should one point its long middle finger at you, you were condemned to death. Some say the appearance of an Aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill the Aye-aye. The Saklava people go so far as to claim Aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's aorta. [citation needed]\r\n\r\nIncidents of Aye-aye killings increase every year as its forest habitats are destroyed and it is forced to raid plantations and villages. Because of the superstition surrounding it, this often ends in death. Fortunately, the superstition can prevent people from hunting them for food.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_17a1n","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6"}

 WARNING:tensorflow:From <ipython-input-25-12e546cf43c5>:71: BasicLSTMCell.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
This class is equivalent as tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell, and will be replaced by that in Tensorflow 2.0.

WARNING: The TensorFlow contrib module will not be included in TensorFlow 2.0.
